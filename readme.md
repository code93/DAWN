The Random generated series does not have a seed and may be following gamma or negative binomial distribution from graphs, need to verify for longer elements of series > 100000 if the series seems to converge,

Implications: are these implying that mathematics can generate truly random numbers (or the numbers themselves have inherent property) or that there is a complex relationship between digits of the numbers after mathematical operation (such as raising to itself) has been performed and the numbers used in the operation.

```bash
python3 fish2.py > fishSequences.txt
python3 fishlist.py
